2 SW prepare
stc-isp-15xx-v6.87B.zip for STC 51 MCU hex download
sdcc-4.0.0-x64-setup.exe for source code build
Git for code management
MinGW for windows development environment

3 Steps
1 Install the SWs
2 prepare source code
3 build and generate hex file
4 connect PC & MCU board serial ports with MAX3232 connecter
5 run stc-isp-15xx-v6.87B.exe, choose chip type, choose hex file, click
"Download/Program"
6 Power on the board, stc isp download software will show message of MCU
found, and download the hex to chip
7 MCU will run immediately after the download complete
